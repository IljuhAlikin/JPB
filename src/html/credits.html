          JPB Group is committed to the highest standards of compliance against
          money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing (CTF). The
          objective of the Companies Policy against Money Laundering and
          Terrorism Financing is to actively prevent the risks of these matters.
          To help the government combat the financing of terrorism and money
          laundering activities, the law requires all financial institutions to
          obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who
          opens an account. We have an obligation to report suspicious client
          activity relevant to money laundering

          Money Laundering: The process of converting funds received from
          illegal activities (such as fraud, corruption, terrorism, etc.) into
          other funds or investments that appear legitimate to hide or distort
          the actual source of funds.
        </p>
        <p class="item-policy-agreement__text">
          The money laundering process can be divided into three sequential
          stages:

            Placement. At this stage, the funds are turned into financial
            instruments, such as checks, bank accounts, and money transfers, or
            they can be used to buy high-value goods that can be resold. They
            can also be physically deposited in banks and non-bank institutions
            (eg exchange houses). To avoid suspicion on the part of the company,
            the bleach can also make several deposits instead of depositing the
            entire sum at once, this form of placement is called smurf.

            interrupt the indication of the entity that carried out the multiple
            financial transactions. Moving funds and changing their form makes
            it difficult to track the money that is being laundered.
